# Description
The Meteor.js [starter tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) in React, but updated with the addition of hooks to eliminate Components.

NOTE: As of September 2020, Meteor has updated their tutorial to include hooks.

# Instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrrliu/todos-meteor-react-hooks.git
cd todos-meteor-react-hooks/
npm install
meteor
```

If you open in VSCode, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) will automatically format on save (you'll have to install the extension too).
You can also enable [eslint](https://eslint.org/) with
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
```
and install the corresponding extension.
